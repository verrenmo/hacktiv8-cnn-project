**by Verren Monica**  
**Phase 2 | Batch: RMT-038**  

## 📌 **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on developing a **computer vision model** to detect the shapes of **cars and motorcycles** to support **traffic management and urban infrastructure planning** more effectively.  

The model is trained using **data augmentation** to enhance dataset diversity and employs a **sequential Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture**. It is evaluated using **accuracy metrics** and further optimized to **improve vehicle detection and classification performance**.  

The final goal is to assist **city governments, transportation agencies, road operators, and urban planners** in making data-driven decisions for better **traffic flow management** and **infrastructure planning**.  

## 📖 **Background**  
Traffic congestion and irregular traffic flow are major challenges in many cities, especially in **developing countries**. The increasing number of **cars and motorcycles** on the roads has created an urgent need for better traffic management and infrastructure development.  

One of the key obstacles to **effective urban planning** is the **lack of accurate data** regarding the number and types of vehicles moving through a specific area. This often leads to ineffective decision-making for **transport policies** and **infrastructure expansion**.  

### 🔍 **How This Model Helps**  
By developing a **computer vision model** that can **differentiate between cars and motorcycles**, this project aims to provide:  
✅ **Accurate vehicle traffic data** for traffic analysis.  
✅ **Automated vehicle monitoring systems** to enhance surveillance.  
✅ **Improved traffic management and urban planning** by providing real-time vehicle classification data.  

The model will be trained on **a diverse dataset of vehicle images** to ensure **robust performance across different real-world conditions**. Its effectiveness will be measured using **accuracy metrics**, ensuring it can reliably classify vehicle types.  

## 🎯 **Objectives**  
✔️ **Develop a computer vision model** to detect and classify cars and motorcycles.  
✔️ **Train the model with data augmentation** to improve dataset diversity and generalization.
