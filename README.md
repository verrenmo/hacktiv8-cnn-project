Hacktiv8 - Graded Challenge Project

- by Verren Monica
- Phase 2
- Batch : RMT - 038
- Project Description : Developing a computer vision model to detect the shapes of cars and motorcycles to support traffic management and urban infrastructure planning more effectively. This computer vision model is trained using data augmentation to enhance dataset diversity and employs a sequential Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The model will be evaluated using accuracy metrics and further improved to enhance vehicle detection and classification performance. This model aims to assist city governments, transportation agencies, road operators, and urban planners.
